# Return Passing
#cpp 

Like [[parameter passing in c++]], return passing can also be passed by **value**, **constant reference**, and **reference**.

- It is always safe to return by value,
- If the object is large, then cosntant reference is better
	- Only when the expression has a lifetime that extends past the return of the function.
