It pissed me off a little bit today.
I wasn't sleeping until 4 or 5 yesterday, I just can't sleep and I don't even know why.
This feeling of never being able to know the truth creates great fear in me.

I also talked with Jason today, and got some advice from him.
I know should not put to much care in to many stuff, I know that I better be careless and move on instead of ruminating on shit.
Today I was thinking about my essensialism.
I have a habit of thinking about everything's essensial.
It pains me greatly when I can not grasp its essensial. Sometime it is just hard to, sometime it is impossible to.
And this apparent pain of not being able to understand hinders me from learning further passed that point.
I need to accept things just exist before they having essensce.
