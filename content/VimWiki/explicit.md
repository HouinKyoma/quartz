# explicit keyword in C++
In c++, one parameter constructors are used as type converters unless `explicit` keyword are declared on the constructor

- Use `explicit` if you don't want the type conversion to happen
- The type is a simple one parameter type, and you want the provided type conversion, then no
- Generally, always add the key word initially.
